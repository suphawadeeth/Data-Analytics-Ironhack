# SQL Questions - Classification

(Use sub queries or views wherever necessary)

1. Create a database called `credit_card_classification`.
2. Create a table `credit_card_data` with the same columns as given in the csv file. Please make sure you use the correct data types for each of the columns.
3. Import the data from the csv file into the table. Before you import the data into the empty table, make sure that you have deleted the headers from the csv file. To not modify the original data, if you want you can create a copy of the csv file as well. Note you might have to use the following queries to give permission to SQL to import data from csv files in bulk:

```sql
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'local_infile'; -- This query would show you the status of the variable â€˜local_infileâ€™. If it is off, use the next command, otherwise you should be good to go

SET GLOBAL local_infile = 1;
```

4.  Select all the data from table `credit_card_data` to check if the data was imported correctly.
5.  Use the _alter table_ command to drop the column `q4_balance` from the database, as we would not use it in the analysis with SQL. Select all the data from the table to verify if the command worked. Limit your returned results to 10.
6.  Use sql query to find how many rows of data you have.
7.  Now we will try to find the unique values in some of the categorical columns:

    - What are the unique values in the column `Offer_accepted`?
    - What are the unique values in the column `Reward`?
    - What are the unique values in the column `mailer_type`?
    - What are the unique values in the column `credit_cards_held`?
    - What are the unique values in the column `household_size`?

8.  Arrange the data in a decreasing order by the `average_balance` of the customer. Return only the `customer_number` of the top 10 customers with the highest `average_balances` in your data.
9.  What is the average balance of all the customers in your data?
10. In this exercise we will use simple `group_by` to check the properties of some of the categorical variables in our data. Note wherever `average_balance` is asked, please take the average of the column `average_balance`: <!-- ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ @himanshu - can we rephrase this? -->

    - What is the average balance of the customers grouped by `Income Level`? The returned result should have only two columns, income level and `Average balance` of the customers. Use an alias to change the name of the second column.
    - What is the average balance of the customers grouped by `number_of_bank_accounts_open`? The returned result should have only two columns, `number_of_bank_accounts_open` and `Average balance` of the customers. Use an alias to change the name of the second column.
    - What is the average number of credit cards held by customers for each of the credit card ratings? The returned result should have only two columns, rating and average number of credit cards held. Use an alias to change the name of the second column.
    - Is there any correlation between the columns `credit_cards_held` and `number_of_bank_accounts_open`? You can analyse this by grouping the data by one of the variables and then aggregating the results of the other column. Visually check if there is a positive correlation or negative correlation or no correlation between the variables.

11. Your managers are only interested in the customers with the following properties:

    - Credit rating medium or high
    - Credit cards held 2 or less
    - Owns their own home
    - Household size 3 or more

    For the rest of the things, they are not too concerned. Write a simple query to find what are the options available for them? Can you filter the customers who accepted the offers here?

12. Your managers want to find out the list of customers whose average balance is less than the average balance of all the customers in the database. Write a query to show them the list of such customers. You might need to use a subquery for this problem.
13. Since this is something that the senior management is regularly interested in, create a view of the same query.
14. What is the number of people who accepted the offer vs number of people who did not?
15. Your managers are more interested in customers with a credit rating of high or medium. What is the difference in average balances of the customers with high credit card rating and low credit card rating?
16. In the database, which all types of communication (`mailer_type`) were used and with how many customers?
17. Provide the details of the customer that is the 11th least `Q1_balance` in your database.

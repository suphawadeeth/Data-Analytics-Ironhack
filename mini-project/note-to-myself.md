# FIFA - MoneyBall: Mini-Project
Group members:
- Andr√© Condre
- Hamideh Aghaei
- Suphawadee Mangold

#### Presentation
Rules:
- 10 minutes
- Leave 3-4 minutes for Q&A

Best practice for presentation:
- Define audience - who is the client (kid, adult)?

## About The Mini-Project
#### Main Objection of The Project
    - End-to-end Data Analysis
    - We focus on linear regression model for this project)

## Objective (for our group):
- Decide the best replacement for a transferred player

========= BRAINSTORM ========= 

### Question during the work process:
#### Who is our audience? Who is our client?
- Investor? 
- Team Manager?
- Kids playing the game

#### Why? 
- They want to buy the best player, to build the best team

#### What are they looking for? (In best of each position)
    
? Position:
- Front
- Middle
- Back
- Goal keeper
    
Characteristics for each position    
- Skill 
- Age range < 30
- Ability (overall) > 80 
- Price (also depens on contract >> release cost)
- Salary??
- BP == CAM
- POT > 75
- Value

Target >> OVA, POT (potential)

========= CHAIN OF THOUGHS ========= 
### 1. Understand project problem (DONE)
- Setup the project question >> DONE (Find the best replacement for a transferred player)

### 2. Understand data / EDA (BEFORE THURSDAY - communicate via Discord)
#### Clean data 

1. Split categorical/numerical columns (DONE)
2. Double check if there are numerical value in the categorical dataset >> move them to numerical dataset (DONE)
    Height, Weight, Value, Wage, Release_Clause, Hits (keep for a bit) >> DONE

#### Check Multi-Colinearity
Remove multicolinearity >> DONE

### 3. Processing Data
- Encoding (cat)
- Concat (num & cat)
- Train-test split
- Training the model (with train set)
- Apply the model >> predict the outcome
- Improve the model

### 4. Finally, answer the question
- I decided to use SQL query, then later on will plot the result using python pandas.

Updated 09.03.2023 >> No need to use SQL, python pandas is enough for this project & plotting graph



#### Our Objective: Decide the best replacement for a transferred player
What is the criteria of "best replacement"?
- After created model and predict the outcome (BOV/OVA), we found these factors are good predictors:

        POT         
        Attacking   
        Skill       
        Movement    
        Power       
        Mentality   
        ase_Stats  
        PAC         
        SHO        
        PAS         
        DRI         
        PHY  

Note: Mentality has low impact to the model, can also drop it.

Updated 11.03.2023 morning >> We're still trying to improve model. 
But I think, at this point, we should move our focus on what graph should look like & what we want to present in the graph.
--> We can now leave the model alone for a bit, move on to plot graph!

Next, we want to visualize the result of best players for replacement

My approach (1-2 graphs, max is 3):
1. Find top 5 players (or maybe 10), rank by BOV (or OVA), show graph x=players, y=BOV score
2. Show the ability of those 5 players (bar graph),group by player, bargraph of those quality (that we want to show)
3. Take money into account, show graph of money related topics for these 5 player


Updated 11.03.2023:
- We were spending too much time wandering about to get the best model. Even we get high r2 but we doubt if it's too good to be true. We lost time on that too much.
- We started to plot graph in the very last hour before the presentation begin. 
- I recalled to look at the clock, it showed 12:37 and we haven't start putting any graph on the powerpoint yet.
- But we sprinted it up & finally made it through.
- Through struggle but it was well executed from our team for the time that we have.
- We simplify the presentation as 12 y/o can understand that he will get the best player as he wanted. 
- I'm so thankful to my teammates, Hamideh (smart yet humble) & Andre (intelligent, enthusiastic), you are beautiful people to work with. Hardworking and encouraging. Thank you so much! Love you guys!!
